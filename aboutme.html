            <p>
                Hello my name is Leon, I am currently studying and working towards becoming fluent in Html, Css, Js and C++, but currently Js is my main priority.
                The things I enjoy doing regularly is gaming, archery, cycling, building and tampering with computers and their coding I also like animals, unfortunately I don't have any pets at the moment but my parent's have some cats and I love them.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to ask more questions or just chat, my @ on discord is bootyleg.exe or you can mail me at contactme@bootyleg.io
            </p>
